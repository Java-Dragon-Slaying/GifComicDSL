Feedback from user studies:
- {} around commands is cumbersome
- "create image" NAME "from" SOURCE is confusing. Does this actually create a new image? Is this a custom image that gets renamed?
- can we put the variable names in quotes but call them without quotes?
- what is SOURCE and how do I know what is valid here?
- how is the end of the header text known? Is everything between "text" and "fontsize" taken as the header?
- what happens if images are added before they are defined? This looks valid but will the DSL crash?

Changes based on above feedback:
- we are going to remove the required {} and replace them with the following:
    a) change {} around create statements to an optional ending ;
    b) add optional , after position when adding images to a panel
- we intended our image create statements to act as variable assignments. NAME is the variable name and SOURCE is an enum element of pre-defined images.
    We're changing the syntax to "use image" SOURCE "as" NAME instead of using "create" as the keyword.
- SOURCE is an enum of pre-defined images that users can call using the string representation of the image path.
    We are still compiling these images in the repo so we haven't made the enum yet. The list of all available images will be on the EBNF/wiki/docs when it's ready
- we are going to require quotes around the header text so it is easier to differentiate the user's text and the following commands.
    "fontsize" is optional so using it to end the user's header wouldn't work if the user decides not to define the font size
- disallowing images to be added to a panel before the image is named will be implemented in the validator.
