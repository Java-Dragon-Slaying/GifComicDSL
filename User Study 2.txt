Feedback from final user studies:
- users naturally put spaces between numbers in coordinates
- importing images is not intuitive to non-programmers (easy to catch on after being told how to do it though)
- the output file looks a little primitive but captures all of our requirements
- all users produced the same (if not very similar in terms of image/panel naming and optional characters) code as we did for the desired output

Changes based on above feedback:
- allow spaces in coordinates (we would need to modify the tokenizer to allow the space and update the parser to use the new tokens)
- update the html file to have more styling so the output looks more polished
