Feedback from final user studies:
- users naturally put spaces between numbers in coordinates
- importing images is not intuitive to non-programmers (easy to catch on after being told how to do it though)

Potential changes based on above feedback:
For the sake of time, we're not implementing these changes but they're good ideas for further improvement.
- allow spaces in coordinates (we would need to modify the tokenizer to allow the space and update the parser to use the new tokens)
